\section{Problems}

1. Let $H$ and $K$ be subgroups of a group $G$. Prove that the product set $HK$ is a subgroup of $G$ iff $HK=KH$. \tb{[Artin Exercise 11.9]}

\noindent

2. Let $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$ be groups and let $Z_{i}$ be the center of $G_{i}$. Prove that the center of the product group $G_{i} \times G_{2}$ is $Z_{i} \times Z_{2}$.  \tb{[Artin Exercise 11.5]}

\vspace{3mm}
\noindent

3. In the general linear group $GL_{3}(\bR)$, consider the subsets 
\[ H = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & \ast & \ast \\ 0 & 1 & \ast \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \quad K = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & \ast \\  0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \] 

where $\ast$ represents an arbitrary real number. Show that H is a subgroup of $GL_{3}$, that K is a normal subgroup of H, and identify the quotient group $H/K$. Determine the center of H. \tb{[Artin Exercise 12.2]}

4. Let $P$ be a partition of a group $G$ with the property that for any pair of elements $A, B$ of the partition, the product set $AB$ contained entirely within another element $C$ of the partition. Let $N$ be the element of $P$ that contains 1. Prove that N is a normal subgroup of $G$ and that $P$ is the set of its cosets. \tb{[Artin Exercises 12.3]}

\noindent 

5. let $G$ be a group, and let $n$ be a positive integer. Consider the relation 
\[ a \sim b \iff (\exists g \in G)ab^{-1} = g^{n} \]

\begin{itemize}
	\item Show that in general $\sim$ is \ti{not} an equivalence relation. 
	\item Prove that $\sim$ is an equivalence relation if $G$ is commutative, and determine the corresponding subgroup of $G$. 
\end{itemize}
\tb{[Aluffi Exercise 7.6]}

6. Let $G$ be a group, and let $[G,G]$ be the subgroup of $G$ generated by all elements of the form $aba^{-1}b^{1}$. (This is the \ti{commutator} subgroup) Prove that $[G,G]$ is normal in $G$. And prove that $G/[G,G]$ is commutative. \tb{[Aluffi Exercise 7.11]}

\vspace{3mm}
\noindent

7. If $f: G \to H$ is a homomorphism, $H$ is abelian and $N$ is a subgroup of $G$ containing the kernel of $f$, then $N$ is normal in $G$. \tb{[Hungerford, Section 5 Exercise 16.]}

\vspace{3mm}
\noindent

8. For subgroups $N \subset M$ of $G$, both normal in $G$, prove that $(G/N)/(M/N) \cong G/M$. \tb{[MacLane, Ch.II; Section 10, Exercise 9]}

\vspace{3mm}
\noindent

9. \textbf{[Optional]} Let $(G_{\alpha})$ be a family of normal subgroups of a group $G$ such that $\bigcap_{\alpha}G_{\alpha}$ = \{e\}; show that $G$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of the product group $\Pi_{\alpha}(G/G_{\alpha})$. \tb{[N.Bourbaki, \S 4 Exercise 6.]}  

\vspace{3mm}
\noindent

10. \textbf{[Optional]} Let $H$ be a subgroup of a finite abelian group $G$. Show that $G$ has a subgroup that is isomorphic to $G/H$. \tb{[Lang, Ch.I, Exercise 43]}
